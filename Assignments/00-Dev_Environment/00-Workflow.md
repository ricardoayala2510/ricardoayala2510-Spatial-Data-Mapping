## 🔄 Workflow Overview

Here’s the “big picture” of how everything fits together:

<img src="https://images2.imgbox.com/da/47/e142Qpan_o.png" width="400">

Think of it like this:

1. **Instructor Repo** (`My Github Repo`) = where you get the assignments.
2. **Student's Repo** = your personal course repo with copies of all your code.
3. **Github Codespaces** = where you actually do the work online.
4. **Assignments → Completed** = A folder of all completed notebooks, or other docs.
5. **D2L** = Where you also upload files when specified.

We can't use D2L as a work platform because this is a coding class, and D2L is extremely less than helpful with ... well anything (except grades) and uploading documents. So that's what we will use it for.

## Steps

[1. Create Your Own GitHub Repository](./02-Github-Repo.md)
[2. Get the Course Assignments]()
[3. Create a GitHub CodeSpace to code in]()

## 4. Connect GitHub to Google Colab

1. Go to [https://colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Click **File → Open Notebook**.
3. Select the **GitHub** tab.
4. Paste your repo URL.
5. Authorize Colab to access GitHub (first time only).
6. Pick a notebook and click **Open**.

## 5. Working on Assignments

- Always open notebooks from **your repo**, not the instructor’s.
- When you finish:
  1. Save in Colab.
  2. Check changes are synced to GitHub.
  3. Move the notebook from `Assignments/` → `Completed/`.

## 6. Submitting Work

I will tell you how to show completed work on D2L later.

## ✅ Quick Recap

- Create your **GitHub repo**.
- Copy over **Assignments/**.
- Use **Colab (GitHub tab)** to edit.
- Move finished work into **Completed/**.

<!-- ## Finally

### Go google Colabs

## Discovery

I discovered that if you replace the `Assignments` folder name with `Completed` it will save that working copy in your completed folder. Remember capitalization matters and spelling matters. Not sure what will happen if you get the path (folder name really) wrong.
